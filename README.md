# Cody Paulay-Simmons
### Entry-Level Data Analyst | Data Science Graduate (May 2026)

I am a Deaf data science student focused on data analysis, visualization, and accessible communication. I work with real-world datasets to uncover patterns, communicate insights clearly, and support data-informed decision-making.

I am currently seeking entry-level data analyst opportunities and am available for remote work. I plan to relocate to Hawaii in February 2027.

# Featured Projects
### Titanic Survival Analysis

Tools: Python, Pandas, Data Visualization
Explored how survival rates varied by passenger class, gender, and age using the Kaggle Titanic dataset. Conducted data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations to uncover key patterns. Found that first-class passengers, women, and children under 10 had the highest survival rates.
